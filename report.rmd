The fools are certain and the intelligent full of doubt. 
-Bertrand Russell

To do:

- Show the high correlation link between yields and bonds

- Talk through and embelish the charts below

- Looks like weekly data going back 2.5 gives the most stable data.  use 'single_experiment_summary.R' on this timeframe to produce a table.

- If there's time, do a history of shock models, showing the results of historic shocks vs what had actually happened at the time.

- Prepare to present to CD.  Then get to work doing Brunswick and AEF versions of these.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
source('./report_chart_PCGLUF_factor_model_results_over_time.R')
ggplot(df_old_and_new, aes(months, pfolio_return_delta_shock, colour = frequency)) + geom_line() + ggtitle("Next pfolio return if yield 100 bp:  model result by timespan and frequency") + facet_wrap( ~ version) + theme(legend.position = "bottom")
ggplot(df_old_and_new, aes(months, bmark_return_delta_shock, colour = frequency)) + geom_line() + ggtitle("Next b'mark return if yield 100 bp:  model result by timespan and frequency") + facet_wrap( ~ version) + theme(legend.position = "bottom")
ggplot(df_old_and_new, aes(months, pfolio_return_delta_shock - bmark_return_delta_shock, colour = frequency)) + geom_line() + ggtitle("Next pfolio - bmark return if yield 100 bp") + facet_wrap( ~ version) + theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
